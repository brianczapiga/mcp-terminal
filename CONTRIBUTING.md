- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
- Use Black for code formatting (line length: 88)
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes

### Code Structure

- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate logging

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies when appropriate

## Commit Message Guidelines

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat: add support for iTerm2 sessions
fix: handle AppleScript timeout errors gracefully
docs: update installation instructions for macOS Ventura
```

## Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: All PRs must pass CI checks
2. **Code Review**: At least one maintainer must approve

## Release Process

1. **Version Bump**: Update version in `pyproject.toml`
2. **Changelog**: Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new changes
3. **Tag Release**: Create a new git tag
4. **Publish**: Release to PyPI (maintainers only)
